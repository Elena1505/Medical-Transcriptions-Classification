# Kaggle competition: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Overview

Medical data is extremely hard to find due to HIPAA privacy regulations. The dataset offers a solution by providing medical transcription samples.
The dataset contains sample medical transcriptions for various medical specialties.

Can we correctly classify the medical specialties based on the transcription text?

## Project Planning 

1) Exploratory analysis of Medical Transcription dataset
2) Data Pre-processing
3) Tf-idf feature extraction
4) T-sne plot of tf-idf features
5) PCA for dimensionality reduction on features followed by  multiclass Logistic Regression
6) Confusion Matrix and Classification Results
7) Domain knowledge to reduce classes
8) Using  scispacy to  extract medical entities
9) Tf-idf feature extraction on reduced classes
10) PCA for dimensionality reduction on features followed by  multiclass Logistic Regression
11) Confusion Matrix and Classification Results
12) SMOTE for imbalanced data
